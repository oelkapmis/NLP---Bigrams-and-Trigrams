# NLTK---Bigrams-and-Trigrams
A basic Python code to determine bigrams and trigrams from corpus via NLTK library.

I have collected some news from Washington Post, The New York Times, BBC and Sputnik. 
Put them together into a text file (corpus)

My basic code is normalizing the raw text and searching for bigrams/trigrams with some filters.

I used Python language on IDLE, and Natural Language Toolkit library functions.
